This was an interesting and fun project looking into bike sales by folks in three different regions based on various factors. It allowed me to use various Excel functions, pivot tables and visualizations to analyze the dataset. 
Bike Sales dashboard

The dataset originally has 13 fields that consist of various information such as the individual's salary, marital status, income and whether they have purchased a bike or not.
Initially, I performed some data cleanup and processing to make it more usable and understandable.
Some of the operations performed were removing duplicates, replacing values in some fields for better interpretability and creating a field Excel functions.
I used pivot tables based on the dataset, with which I was able to generate the charts in the dashboard shown above.
The dashboard has 4 primary components that are listed below:
->Average income of individuals that purchased a bike, grouped by gender 
->Bike purchases made by individuals based on the distance they need to commute (Top-Right).
->Percentage of the population in different occupations and regions that purchased a bike (Bottom).
There are also  filters that can be used for all of these charts i.e. Martial status, Level of education, and the Region.
The age groups used are Adolescent (<31 years), Middle Age (>=31 years) and Old (>54).
